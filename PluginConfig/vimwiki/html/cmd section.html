– The .cinit section and the .pinit section contain tables for initializing variables and constants.
The C28x .cinit record is limited to 16 bits. This limits initialized objects to 64K.
– The .const section contains string constants, switch tables, and data defined with the C/C++
qualifier const (provided the constant is not also defined as volatile).
– The .econst section contains string constants, and the declaration and initialization of global and
static variables (qualified by far const or the use of the large memory model) that are explicitly
initialized and placed in far memory.
– The .switch section contains tables for switch statements.
– The .text section contains all the executable code as well as string literals and compiler-generated
constants.
• Uninitialized sections reserve space in memory (usually RAM). A program can use this space at run
time to create and store variables. The compiler creates the following uninitialized sections:
– The .bss section reserves space for global and static variables. At boot or load time, the C/C++
boot routine copies data out of the .cinit section (which can be in ROM) and stores it in the .bss
section.
– The .ebss section reserves space for global and static variables defined as far (C only) or when
the large memory model is used. At program startup time, the C/C++ boot routine copies data out
of the .cinit section (which can be in ROM) and uses it for initializing variables in the .ebss section.
– The .stack section reserves memory for the C/C++ software stack. This memory is used to pass
arguments to functions and to allocate space for local variables.
– The .sysmem section reserves space for dynamic memory allocation. The reserved space is used
by dynamic memory allocation routines, such as malloc, calloc, realloc, or new. If a C/C++ program
does not use these functions, the compiler does not create the .sysmem section.
– The .esysmem section reserves space for dynamic memory allocation. The reserved space is
used by far malloc functions. If a C/C++ program does not use far malloc, the compiler does not
create the .esysmem section.
